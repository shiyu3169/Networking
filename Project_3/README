Experiment 1

Topology: 

N1            N4
  \          /
   \	    /
    N2————N3

Bandwidth: N1-N2: 30 Mbps
	  	  N2-N3: 10 Mbps
          N3-N4: 30 Mbps


Measurements: TCP’s throughput, drop rate and latency

TCP flavors tested: Tahoe, Reno, NewReno and Vegas 

Experiment:

	Step 1:
		Initiate TCP between N1-N4	
	Step 2:
		Initiate CBR between N2-N3 at flow rate of 1 Mbps, do TCP measurements 
	Step3:
		while ( 10mbps bottleneck capacity of N2, N3 is not reached):
				increase CBR flow rate by 1 Mbps
				do TCP measurements

Plots:
	1. Throughput (y coordinate) vs. CBR flow rate (x coordinate)
	2. Drop rate (y coordinate) vs. CBR flow rate (x coordinate)
	3. Latency (y coordinate) vs.  CBR flow rate (x coordinate)

Experiment 2

Bandwith: 
	N1-N2: 30 mpbs
	N5-N2: 30 mpbs
  	N2-N3: 10 mbps
    N3-N4: 30 mbps
    N3-N6: 30 mbps

Measurements: N1->N4 and N5->N6 TCP throughput, drop rate and latency

Experiment:

	X/Y pair = Reno/Reno, NewReno/Reno, Vegas/Vegas, NewReno/Vegas

	To analyze fairness between different TCP variants, two variants are compared in the same environment for the distribution of bandwidth with a common CBR. 
	N2->N3: CBR over UDP
	N1->N4: TCP flow of variant X 
	N5->N6: TCP flow of variant Y 

	1.	For each X, Y pair:
		i.  Initia a CBR flow from N2 -> N3 with bandwidth of 1 Mbps
		ii.	Initiate TCP X between N1-N4, TCP Y between N5 - N6 at the same time
			a. While ( 10mbps bottleneck capacity of N2, N3 is not reached):
				(1). Measure throughput, drop-rate, latency.
				(2). Increase CBR flow rate by 1 Mbps

Plots:
	For each X, Y TCP variants pair
	1. Throughput (y coordinate) vs. CBR flow rate (x coordinate)
	2. Drop rate (y coordinate) vs. CBR flow rate (x coordinate)
	3. Latency (y coordinate) vs.  CBR flow rate (x coordinate)
