Experiment 1

Topology: 

N1            N4
  \          /
   \	    /
    N2————N3

Bandwidth: N1-N2: 30 Mbps
	  	  N2-N3: 10 Mbps
          N3-N4: 30 Mbps


Measurements: TCP’s throughput, drop rate and latency

TCP flavors: Tahoe, Reno, NewReno and Vegas

Experiment:

	Step 1:
		Initiate TCP between N1-N4	
	Step 2:
		Initiate CBR between N2-N3 at flow rate of 1 Mbps, make TCP measurements
	Step3:
		while ( 10mbps bottleneck capacity of N2, N3 is not reached):
				increase CBR flow rate by 1 Mbps
				do TCP measurements

Plots:
	1. Throughput (y coordinate) vs. CBR flow rate (x coordinate)
	2. Drop rate (y coordinate) vs. CBR flow rate (x coordinate)
	3. Latency (y coordinate) vs.  CBR flow rate (x coordinate)

Measurements: N2-N3 CBR throughput, drop rate and latency

Experiment:

	X/Y pair = Reno/Reno, NewReno/Reno, Vegas/Vegas, NewReno/Vegas

	To analyze fairness between different TCP variants, two variants are compared in the same environment for the distribution of bandwidth with a common CBR. 
	N2->N3: CBR over UDP
	N1->N4: TCP flow of variant X 
	N5->N6: TCP flow of variant Y 

	1.	For each X, Y pair:
		i.  Initia a CBR flow from N2 -> N3 with bandwidth of 1 Mbps
		ii.	Initiate TCP X between N1-N4, TCP Y between N5 - N6 at the same time
			a. While ( 10mbps bottleneck capacity of N2, N3 is not reached):
				(1). Measure throughput, drop-rate, latency.
				(2). Increase CBR flow rate by 1 Mbps

Bandwidth: 10 Mbps for each link

Measurements: TCP's throughput, drop rate and latency between N1-N4
              CBR's throughput, drop rate and latency between N1-N4

TCP flavors: Reno, Sack

Experiment:
     1. Start TCP connection between N1-N4
     2. Start CBR between N5 and N6 after 2 second.
     3. Keep all the connection running for 8 more seconds, make measurements
     4. Change to the other queueing mechanism, restart the experiment

Plots:
    1. TCP's throughput and CBR's throughput (y coordinate) vs. time (x coordinate)
	2. TCP's drop rate and CBR's drop rate (y coordinate) vs. time (x coordinate)
	3. TCP's latency and CBR's latency (y coordinate) vs. time (x coordinate)
