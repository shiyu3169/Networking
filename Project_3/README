Topology: 

N1            N4
  \          /
   \	    /
    N2————N3

Bandwith: N1-N2: 30 mpbs
	  N2-N3: 30 mbps
          N3-N4: 30 mbps


Measurements: TCP’s throughput, drop rate and latency

TCP flavors tested: Tahoe, Reno, NewReno and Vegas 

Experiment:

	Step 1:
		Initiate TCP between N1-N4	
	Step 2:
		Initiate CBR between N2-N3 at flow rate of 1 Mbps, do TCP measurements 
	Step3:
		while ( 10mbps bottleneck capacity of N2, N3 is not reached):
				increase CBR flow rate by 1 Mbps
				do TCP measurements

Plots:
	1. Throughput (y coordinate) vs. CBR flow rate (x coordinate)
	2. Drop rate (y coordinate) vs. CBR flow rate (x coordinate)
	3. Latency (y coordinate) vs.  CBR flow rate (x coordinate)
