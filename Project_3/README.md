# TCP-Compare

## Approach
In this project, we present the result of our study on the performances of different TCP variants. 
The NS-2 network simulator is used as the main tool for this study. 
We compared the performances of TCP Tahoe, Reno, New Reno and Vegas under different situations. 
In experiment 1, we analyze the performance of each one under different congestions. 
In experiment 2, we simulate two TCP flows to analyze how well they share bandwidth and their fairness to each other. 
In experiment 3, how queueing mechanism used in buffer impacts the TCP performance is studied. 
At the end of the paper, the key results from these experiments are highlighted.
