Approach
In the DNS part, our high level approach is basically the same as the approach we took for Project 4.
We create a class called DNS packet, this is the template we use to generate or parse DNS packets. The class dnsserver listens on a UDP port for incoming DNS requests.
For HTTP part, It basically need to do 5 things under different conditions:
1. Accept and parse request from client
2. Send request to origin and accept response from it
3. send response to client
4. check if we have requested content in cache
5. store http content in cache (and check if cache is full)

Therefore, our HTTP server is working along this process to firstly listen request from client. Then we check if we have
the requested content in cache. If we have it, return it to client. Otherwise, we request it from origin and send it to client.
Meanwhile we store it in cache. If cache is out of space, we delete things barely used.


Challenge
Currently, our DNS server is still iterative.  We need to use thread to make it able to handle multiple requests at the same time.
Similarly, HTTP is using concurrent processes with fork() to deal with multiple users. However, we believe there is still problem (such as multiprocess write to cache at the same time) which needed to be taken care.

Work Seperation
For milestone part
We separate our work into DNS and HTTP.
